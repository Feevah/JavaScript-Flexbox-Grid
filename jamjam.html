Yes. The fire rises.

To manipulate the fears in others, you must first master your own. Are you ready to begin?

No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

I got another another job. Your.

Now choice is yours: exile or death?

When their enemies were at the gates the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service.

I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.

You wanna know how I got these scars? My father was... a drinker, and a fiend. And one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that, not one bit. So, me watching he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me and he says: "Why so serious?". He comes at me with the knife "Why so serious?". He sticks the blade in my mouth. "Let's put a smile on that face." and... Why so serious?

Oh, hee-hee, aha. Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha. And I thought my jokes were bad.

But it's not who you are underneath... it's what you do that defines you.

You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.

You can swapnot sleeping in a penthouse... for not sleeping in a mansion. Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess.

I'm Gotham's reckoning. It'll end the ball of damns you've all been living on. A necessary evil.
